What are some common HTTP status codes?
404 - the resource you're trying to access cannot be found
403 - machine trying to access the resource is forbidden from doing so
200 - everything is all good, can connect without issue!
503 - web server you're trying to access is currently unavailable

I also learned that you can get a general idea of status code meanings depending on the number they start with: 1xx are informational, 2xx are success, 3xx are redirection, 4xx are client errors, and 5xx are server errors

What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
A GET request is used for viewing information, whereas a POST request is used for changing something. An example I saw was using a POST request if you're giving the user a form to change their password, and using a GET request for something like a seachpage or a homepage.
