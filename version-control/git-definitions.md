# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows you to see everything that's happening with your code, and gives you the opportunity to revert to previous version of the code if you choose to do so. It's very useful for the purpose of backing up all of your code, and giving you a chance to go back in time.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch allows for you to work on a copy of your master code without effecting the master code itself. You would use a branch if you wanted to test any potential adjustments to your code before applying them to the master code. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point within your code. A good commit message explains what has changed since the previous save point/commit. 

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is a conflict that arises in git when attempting to merge different branches together. If there are competing changes in the branches that you are trying to merge, then you will see a merge conflict.
